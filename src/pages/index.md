  title: NICE TO MEET YOU
  description: Hey, I’m Robert, Events Planner and Consultant
description: My life has been committed to discovering my passion and learning
  the best way to develop myself into the person I want to become. This has led
  me to a lot of humanitarian work and exposure to poorer communities, which
  includes my existing service to the poor in Las Vegas. The exposure I have had
  to the human need for sustainable housing is the source of my inspiration for
  my current endeavors in the study of engineering. I am an established resident
  of Nevada and a student at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Skilled in
  design practices, Microsoft Office, AutoCad, engineering and construction
  concepts. I fill roles of leadership and teamwork in the community and in
  organizations including Engineers Without Borders, the Las Vegas Catholic
  Worker, Tau Beta Pi Honor Society, the Nevada Desert Experience and the
  American Society of Civil Engineers. There are many projects that I am proud
  to be a part of and I encourage others to reach out to me if they are
  interested in working on a project together.

  description: >
    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
