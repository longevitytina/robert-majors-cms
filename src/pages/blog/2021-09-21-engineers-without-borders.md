  Knowledge is a gift to the world and working with Engineers Without Borders
  allows gifted professionals to share their ability with countries that do not
  have the resources to meet necessary goals. Working with communities to create
  infrastructure, EWB engages student volunteers to help organize projects from
  their local campus. At the University of Nevada Las Vegas Chapter we are
  currently working on a school house to be built in Guatemala. The current cost
  for the project is $50,000 and we are always looking for ways to raise funds
  and volunteers that can help with the project.
